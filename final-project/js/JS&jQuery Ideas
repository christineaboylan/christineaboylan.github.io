Through the use of JS and jQuery, I am looking to accomplish the following:

1. Scroll left nd right using background positioning/keydown functions
2. Implement a form that will capture and store data from users
3. Use the on.click function to have users submit contact information/send emails
4. Install a widget that can connect users to my LinkedIn or other forms of social media
